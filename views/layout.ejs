        Stylesheets and Preprocessors
        ==============================

        You can always bring in CSS files manually with `link` tags, or asynchronously
        on the client using a solution like AMD (RequireJS).  Or, if you like, you can
        take advantage of Sails' boilerplate asset management.

        By default, tylesheets from your `assets/linker/styles` folder are included
        here automatically.  Both CSS (.css) and LESS (.less) are supported.
        In production, your styles will be minified and concatenated into a single file.

        To customize any part of the built-in behavior, just edit your Gruntfile.
        For example, here are a few things you could do:

            + Change the order of your CSS files
            + Import stylesheets from other directories
            + Use a different or additional preprocessor, like SASS, SCSS or Stylus
    -->

    <!--STYLES-->
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="/linker/styles/app.css">
    <!--STYLES END-->
  </head>

      Client-side Javascript
      ========================

      You can always bring in JS files manually with `script` tags, or asynchronously
      on the client using a solution like AMD (RequireJS).  Or, if you like, you can
      take advantage of Sails' boilerplate asset management.

      By default, filesin your `assets/linker/js` folder are included here
      automatically.  Both JavaScript (.js) and CoffeeScript (.coffee) are supported.
      In production, your scripts will be minified and concatenated into a single file.

      To customize any part of the built-in behavior, just edit your Gruntfile.
      For example, here are a few things you could do:

          + Change the order of your scripts
          + Import scripts from other directories
          + Use a different preprocessor, like TypeScript

    <!--SCRIPTS-->
    <script src="/js/socket.io.js"></script>
    <script src="/js/sails.io.js"></script>
    <script src="/js/jquery-1.9.1.js"></script>
    <script src="/js/handlebars.js"></script>
    <script src="/js/ember-1.0.0-rc.7.js"></script>
    <script src="/js/ember-model-latest.js"></script>
    <script src="/js/app.js"></script>
    <script src="/linker/js/controllers/todo_controller.js"></script>
    <script src="/linker/js/controllers/todos_controller.js"></script>
    <script src="/linker/js/models/todo.js"></script>
    <script src="/linker/js/router.js"></script>
    <script src="/linker/js/views/edit_todo_view.js"></script>
    <!--SCRIPTS END-->

    <!--
        Client-side Templates
        ========================

        HTML templates are important prerequisites of modern, rich client applications.
        To work their magic, frameworks like Backbone, Angular, Ember, and Knockout require
        that you load these templates client-side.

        By default, your Gruntfile is configured to automatically load and precompile
        client-side JST templates in your `assets/linker/templates` folder, then
        include them here automatically.

        To customize this behavior to fit your needs, just edit your Gruntfile.
        For example, here are a few things you could do:

            + Import templates from other directories
            + Use a different template engine (handlebars, jade, dust, etc.)
            + Internationalize your templates using a server-side stringfile
              before they're served.

    <!--TEMPLATES-->
    <script type="text/javascript" src="/hbs.js"></script>
    <!--TEMPLATES END-->
