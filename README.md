# Sails + Ember
## Working
* Javascript is being used
* Ember is running
* Handlebars is compiling
* I do not like LESS
* I prefer SASS
* Even dogs likes Javascript
* TODOS TODOS TODOS

## Why Ember.Model?
* Closest thing to what Sails outputs by default (and sanity saving features like collectionKey)
* .json in the URL easily worked around with ajaxSettings
* Currently using [this branch](https://github.com/pansapien/ember-model/tree/streamed-updates) from @pansapien and tracking [this PR](https://github.com/ebryn/ember-model/pull/214)

## TODO
* Clean up the realtime implementation to be more Ember-like
