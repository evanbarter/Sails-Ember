# [Sails](https://github.com/balderdashy/sails) + [Ember](https://github.com/emberjs/ember.js)
## Working
* Javascript is being used
* Ember is running
* Handlebars is compiling
* I do not like LESS
* I prefer SASS
* Even dogs likes Javascript
* TODOS TODOS TODOS

## Why Ember.Model?
* Closest thing to what Sails outputs by default (and sanity saving features like collectionKey)
* .json in the URL easily worked around with ajaxSettings
* Currently using [this branch](https://github.com/pansapien/ember-model/tree/streamed-updates) from @pansapien and tracking [this PR](https://github.com/ebryn/ember-model/pull/214)

## TODO
* I mentioned I'd like to get [JSON API](http://jsonapi.org) support in to Sail, then maybe consider [Ember Data](https://github.com/emberjs/data).

## Credits
[This post](http://livsey.org/blog/2013/02/10/integrating-pusher-with-ember/) was incredibly useful in demonstrating how to clean up/better implement socket.io support.
